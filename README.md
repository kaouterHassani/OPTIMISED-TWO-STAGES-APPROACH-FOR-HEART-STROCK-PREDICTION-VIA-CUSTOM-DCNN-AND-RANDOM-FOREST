# OPTIMISED-TWO-STAGES-APPROACH-FOR-HEART-STROCK-PREDICTION-VIA-CUSTOM-DCNN-AND-RANDOM-FOREST
The goal of this research is to develop a new approach for predicting the probability of heart disease. By leveraging machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), the project aims to improve decision-making processes and achieve highly accurate predictions of heart disease.
